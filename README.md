# Cylon.js Meetup

I made a MeArm v1.0 and used Cylon.js with a Raspberry Pi to control the 4 servos.

Google Slides from the talk: [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eV1NJfY0SrKhzPacw-P2wvpTI4HIxDmIpM6qB84RRV8/edit?usp=sharing).

In the near future, I hope to:
* Add kinematics for smoother and precise movement (pending a new build with some better materials)
* Add some other bells and whistles
* Figure out socketio namespaces in relation to Cylon.js (so that I don't need a socket per servo)
